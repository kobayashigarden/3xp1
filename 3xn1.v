(* Function of natural numbers *)
Definition f (x : nat) : nat :=
  if Nat.odd x then 3 * x - 1 else x / 2.

Inductive reaches_1 : nat → Prop :=
  | term_done : reaches_1 1
  | term_more (n : nat) : reaches_1 (f n) → reaches_1 n.

Axiom term_loop : forall n m, (reaches_1 (f n) <-> reaches_1 (f m)) -> ¬ reaches_1 n.

Lemma not_reaches_1_5 : ¬ reaches_1 5.
Proof.

    - intros; do 2 apply term_more; cbn; auto.
