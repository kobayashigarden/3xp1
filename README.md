# 3x + 1 problem

This is a complete formal proof of the Collatz conjecture, a well-known unsolved problem in mathematics.

  All theory and all implementation of this proof was developed entirely by Teruyuki and Yoko Kobayashi.  
  This project began in May 2022 and was completed in March 2023.

  We have not been able to obtain the cooperation of any academic institution and therefore lack the funds.  
  We need R&D funds to help us.

Works with Coq 8.16. https://github.com/coq/coq
